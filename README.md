# Huffman_MSDS-696_Project
Repository for Regis University Capstone project

The purpose of this project is to perform a sentiment analysis on tweets from Colorado counties related to the COVID-19 outbreak and CDC recommended best practices for containing the spread of COVID-19, such as hand-washing, social distancing, and wearing masks.  This information will be used to create a sentiment score for each county that will describe how positive or negative individuals are in the county as a whole toward a particular idea or policy. 

Once the sentiment analysis has been performed, the opinions of each county will be compared to the number of COVID-19 cases per capita of the county and used to create a prediction model with the intent of predicting the infection rate.

The data for this project will mainly be pulled from Twitter to perform the sentiment analysis and covid19.colorado.gov to get the infection information.

If an accurate prediction model can be created, then potential hotspots can be identified earlier by tracking shifts in opinions.  This could help health departments and county governments be proactive in distributing information and implanting policies in an effort to mitigate the potential spread.
